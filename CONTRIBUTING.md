## Development Flow

Development workflow is like the following;

### 0. Check Issues

Check existing [issues](https://github.com/photo-cli/photo-cli/issues) to look if there is a related issue exists. If not, create issue first.

If you are not certain about your request or bug, create a discussion first and let's discuss together on [discussions](https://github.com/photo-cli/photo-cli/discussions).

No big pull/merge requests. If your changes requires a lot of change, start a discussion or issue first, so we can agree on direction.

### 1. Deciding Version

We are using release branch flow and actively develop on related release branch depending its' semantic version like `r/0.0.1`, `r/0.2.7`.

Target version should be:
  - If it is a major change: `r/{{current-major+1}}.0.0`
  - If it is a minor change: `r/{{current-major}}.{{current-minor+1}}.0`
  - If it is a patch change: `r/{{current-major}}.{{current-minor}}.{{current-patch+1}}`

### 2. Is Version Still Developing?

Check whether your related change version still accepts issues on [our boards.](https://github.com/photo-cli/photo-cli/projects)

Boards:
- [Active Versions](https://github.com/photo-cli/photo-cli/projects?query=is:open)
- [Closed, Published Stable Version on Nuget](https://github.com/photo-cli/photo-cli/projects?query=is:closed)

### 3. Fork & Develop on Release Branch

Create a fork on your local repository and work on your related version branch.

While developing consider the following items;

- Follow our [code style](#code-style-rules).
- For new features; write unit, integration, end-to-end tests.
- For fixing bugs; Should add a tests that highlights current behavior is broken.
- Keep your commits atomic and descriptive. It should revolve only one task.
- For commit messages, use our [commit message formats](#commit-message-formats).
- Not to large with unrelated things in same commit.
- Not so small changes applied on many commits.
- No merge commits in your branch, use rebase on personal branches.

### 4. Create a Pull/Merge Request

Your changes should be targeted only on your related version branch. As a community we iteratively discuss and give feedbacks about these changes in a positive manner.

After agreement about these changes and CI is not broken, we will merge your changes.

### 4. Publishing Preview Version

Tool deployment to Nuget, done via GitHub actions on tag push on release branch `r/{major}.{minor}.{patch}`.

After completing development on release branch, first we push preview version with this git tag. `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-preview[0-9]`

This preview version is for contributors and early adapters(who installs and love to use preview versions) to test.

### 5. Publishing Stable Version

If preview version is stable and passes our tests, we will push stable version via this tag. `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`

After pushing stable version on release branch `r/{major}.{minor}.{patch}` , we will merge this changes to `main` branch.

The `main` branch should matches with the current stable release on nuget.org.

### 6. Merging Concurrent Changes on Different Branches

If there is a changed on lower version emerged, these changes should be merged firstly into `main` and then active upper release branches.

### Code Style Rules
